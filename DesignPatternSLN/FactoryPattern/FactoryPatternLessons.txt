A Factory method handles object creation and encapsulates it in a subclass.
This decouples the client code in the superclass from object creation code in
the subclass.

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object , but lets
subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instatiation to 
subclasses.
